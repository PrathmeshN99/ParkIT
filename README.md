# ParkApp

## Introduction and Motivation

The number of automobiles is increasing, and the parking places that are available are proving to be insufficient and sometimes badly managed.
It is estimated that 30% of vehicles on the road in the downtown area of major cities are cruising for a parking spot.
Some of the parking problems faced in Indian metropolitan cities are saturated parking spaces, unregulated tariffs, parking in residential areas and unregulated parking.

Some points:
Unauthorized and disorganized parking in urban areas
Poor management, a lack of real-time or live guidance, and general ignorance
Greenhouse gases
Economic growth
Frustration and unnecessary stress

The proposed method is robust to non-standard parking behaviours, such as cars occupying multiple parking lots

This method is expected to exhibit very high accuracy, even in presence of noise due to light conditions variation, shadows, and partial occlusions with the help of Convolutional Neural Networks

Finally, the system shows the application of car slot detection as a means to track the capacity in parking lots over time without the expenses of hardware such as motion sensors or labor of parking lot managers patrolling at regular intervals
